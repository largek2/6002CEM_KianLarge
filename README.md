6002CEM - Mobile Food Delivery App (Mexican Fiesta)
main-DB is the final branch with all features implemented.

Motivation:

The initial plan for the Mexican Fiesta was to create a menu including different categories such as starters, mains, desserts and drinks. However, in the process of planning out the different features to implement, there would be many pages with the same templates and layouts. I decided that I did not want to have the same type of feature just being repeated throughout the app because it would be boring and look lazy. This is when the idea of a food ordering app like Uber Eats came about as this provided different feature opportunities to be able to explore and delve into. The features that were put into effect are going to be covered in the section below in a lot more detail.
